## 🌟 **Other Notable Projects**
🧠 **NeuroGenix Alpha**  
NeuroGenix Alpha is a theoretical research project aimed at combating Alzheimer’s disease through innovative neuroprotective biologics.

- **Description**: Developed a recombinant protein combining Sirtuin-6 (SIRT6) and the catalytic domain of telomerase (TERT) to repair DNA damage and maintain telomere length, addressing aging and neurodegeneration.
  
- **Highlights**:
  - Designed for intranasal administration to cross the blood-brain barrier.
  - Targets oxidative stress in brain cells for age-delaying and neuroprotective effects.

### Achievements
